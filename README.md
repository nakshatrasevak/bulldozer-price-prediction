ðŸšœ Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning

Since we're trying to predict a number, we are dealing with a regression problem.

The data and evaluation metric we'll be using (root mean square log error or RMSLE) is from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition.

Since we already have a dataset, we'll approach the problem with the following machine learning modelling framework.

1. Problem Definition
For this dataset, the problem we're trying to solve, or better, the question we're trying to answer is,

How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?
